## Description

 The main function of the application is to create expense lists, in order to keep a quick record and calculation of what has been spent.
Subsequently, I decided to add 'chat-like' lists to emulate the practice of using messaging app windows as personal note lists.

For this first programming project/practice, I also wanted to take the opportunity to implement user interface and user experience design concepts since the aim for the application was to be used as easily as possible by family and friends from whom I could receive feedback, both on design and functionality, as well as any errors.

The keys for the UX/UI design were:

- UI similar to messaging apps to make it familiar.
- Expense lists similar to a "grocery store receipt", as it's - a well-known format.
- An accessible color palette according to WCAG AAA.
- An easily memorable name.

## Application development

 I developed this application while studying Java. Android applications were a good fit for practicing the language and, at the same time, developing something with a simple and accessible deployment to share and receive feedback from some users.

Additionally, in this development, I also learned about the Android Studio framework, became familiar with the life cycle of its views (Activities/Fragments), the XML "vocabulary" it uses to declare its graphical interface components, and how to structure its resources.

Although supported by the structure the framework establishes, the code doesn't enjoy overly clean and organized writing and structure since I developed it at an early stage of my learning.
